Updated: now

Resend (resend.com) is the service provider for all transactional emails sent via the custom domain fomo.com.cy. ALL email functions use the unified 'From' address **support@fomo.com.cy** — no other from addresses (noreply@, tickets@, offers@, notifications@, reminders@, suggestions@) are used, as only support@ is verified in Resend.
